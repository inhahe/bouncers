# bouncers
Fun screensaver-like program

You'll have to see it to understand. This contains a few versions of it I wrote in assembly a long time ago and a VC++ 2017 version I wrote just now. You'll probably have to jump through hoops to make any of the assembly ones work work because I think I wrote them for 16-bit DOS (DOSBox or Windows 10's free WinXP mode should work). The assembly source was written for NASM (I think YASM would also work?).

keys in the c++ version: 
  right bracket: add a bouncer
  left bracket: subtract the last bouncer
  esc: quit
  r: re-randomize all the bouncers
